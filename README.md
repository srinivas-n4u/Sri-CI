# Sri-CI

We have lot of new projects like JenkinsX, Tekton, etc are getting devloped or evolving for kubcernetes based CICD. This project is not so advanced like them, but just wanted to provide what I have devloped last year using Jenkins shared libraries. By using this shared library we should be able to create Jenkins pipelines using simple yaml file and a dummy Jenkisfile.

#Prerequisites
